üìò Personal Website ‚Äî Project Spec (v2.0)

üß≠ Purpose

To create an immersive, game menu-inspired personal website that:
	‚Ä¢	Establishes personal brand and identity (not portfolio-first)
	‚Ä¢	Feels like navigating a console game interface (PS2/Xbox dashboard style)
	‚Ä¢	Has unique retro-futurism aesthetic with functional UI elements
	‚Ä¢	Sets foundation for dynamic modules (music viz, goals, etc.) within the menu system
	‚Ä¢	Makes all key links and navigation immediately accessible

‚∏ª

üß© Core Features (MVP)

	‚Ä¢	Active selection indicator (LED/glow effect)
	‚Ä¢	Smooth transitions between menu sections

‚úÖ 2. About Module
	‚Ä¢	Personal narrative focused on identity and ambitions
	‚Ä¢	What I care about (leverage, AI-native systems, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Presented as a game menu panel/window

‚úÖ 3. Projects Module
	‚Ä¢	Accessed through menu navigation
	‚Ä¢	2‚Äì3 projects displayed as interactive cards
	‚Ä¢	Each card: title, blurb, status (WIP, shipped, concept), and optional link
	‚Ä¢	Styled like game UI elements or synth controls

‚úÖ 4. Music Module (Placeholder)
	‚Ä¢	Placeholder for future Last.fm integration
	‚Ä¢	Hardcoded list of favorite artists for now
	‚Ä¢	Prepare structure for future visualizations
	‚Ä¢	Styled as audio/media control panel

üé® Design Direction
	‚Ä¢	Retro-futurism game UI (PS2/Xbox era menus)
	‚Ä¢	Dark base with neon/LED accents (green, blue, red)
	‚Ä¢	Depth through shadows, gradients, and bevels
	‚Ä¢	Panel-based layout with gloss/glass effects
	‚Ä¢	Motion design for menu navigation and hover states
