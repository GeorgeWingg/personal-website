        Hey, I’m George – a builder obsessed with leverage, AI-native systems and
        thoughtful product design. I’ve spent the last few years shipping tools
        that help people move faster by collaborating with machines. When I’m
        not coding, you’ll find me exploring new music or scribbling product
        ideas in a notebook.
